1. The ES data contained in ES include basic data for assessing ecosystem services. After assessment using the InVEST model, the amount of ecosystem services can be obtained.
2. Use correlation analysis data to run the correlation analysis code to derive trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services.
3. Use the formula to calculate the intensity of trade-offs in ecosystem services and run the tif map through the pixel-by-pixel analysis code to derive its spatial distribution characteristics.
4. Organize the intensities of ecosystem services one by one and run the XGBoost-SHAP code.
